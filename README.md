# microcontroller-library
This repo serves as a source of truth for scripts and code for deploying/managing microcotrollers (mostly RPi). Will include some ansible on registering Pi's as an on-prem instance for AWS management, code for specific RPi use-cases, and more. One-stop shop for all the things I want to do with microcontrollers.
